# Collision in the Wild

These two memes with noticeably different layouts produce the same image hash,
`d8044c7d7058c01f9dbbce61`.

- Coffin: `coffin.jpg`

![Coffin](coffin.jpg?raw=true "d8044c7d7058c01f9dbbce61")

- Sleep: `sleep.png`

![Sleep](sleep.png?raw=true "d8044c7d7058c01f9dbbce61")

I do not have evidence that these images were not artificially crafted. I will
note that, upon computing collisions for a wide array of these types of images,
extremely low collisions are common (very frequently only 1-3 bits are
different).
